            Yaanim was reportedly found dead infront of the biruveri hoholha, for 1 whole night. His entire body was busted open, with his guts fully displayed and seen to the outside world. Shockingly, Eyewitness accounts show that he came back alive sometimes too.<br><br>Yaanim was quoted to have said &quot;the blood tastes like jam&quot;. No one knows how he was met with this condition, although recent investigation suggests Molhey Sir is yet again, in the line of potential suspects.
