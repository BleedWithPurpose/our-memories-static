            During the wait in the long line for the graduation photo taking, the 12A and C class boys challenged each other to a volley tournament. And thus all the boys from both sides were in agreement to meet at 6 15 on Saturday morning<br>Although some were late, and some couldn&#x27;t wake up, the majority of both classes graduates were present. And the volley match commenced<br>With unaish and the 12A boys on one side to balance out the number of players, a beat of 5 sets game commenced with the 12C group winning 3-1. Albeit, most of the 12A boys didn&#x27;t played volley beforehand, thus we commend their openness to trying new stuff. We are looking forward to more volley battles, and so are they.
