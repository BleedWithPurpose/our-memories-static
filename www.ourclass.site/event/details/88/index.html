            So in a span of 30 minutes, we were able to plan out a whole BBQ and go to buy stuff. The boys searched far and wide for chicken and sausages which was suprisingly not in any of the shops except one. Furthermore, there was a whole havaa eruvun thing today, so we handed over all the chicken to Ms. Lonumirus her self, Shaba. We also raided zeeshans house and hisham talked to her mom.
